      <h1>Community Outreach</h1>
<p>HHC has a number of outreach projects working to improve communities across INDIA. HHC’s Community Education Initiatives are aimed at raising awareness and building community networks. This includes educating school children on the risks of trafficking using targeted media, distributing educational and hygiene materials for women’s menstrual health, and helping to bring the internet to rural schools.

    <h1>HHC’s Anti-Trafficking Campaign</h1>
    <p>The rate of child trafficking in Indore is shocking – UNICEF estimates each year at least 13,000 indore children are trafficked to India alone. Domestic and international trafficking are both common, and many thousands of children are forced to work in hazardous jobs or sexually exploited.

<br><br>
HHC has partnered with Cause Vision and SASANE to produce and distribute a Indore language comic book, entitled “Chameli Goes to School”, which raises awareness and educates students about the dangers of trafficking. HHC has printed and distributed 10,000 educational comic books to children, families and schools throughout the central regions of Indore where children are especially vulnerable.
